# Z30-Enigma-Codebook-generator

This repository contains the following:

1. z30codebook.pl - a perl script that generates a month's worth of code settings for the Z30 Numbers only Engima, as recreated by ardunioenigma. 
2. prepro.pl - a perl script that acts as a translator for the ardunioenigma Z30 schema where A = 01, B = 02 etc...  Takes alphabetic input and outputs it inn numerica format ready.
